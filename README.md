This repository contains data and data analysis made with Python in the context of my laboratory courses during my bachelors degree in Physics.

AP1-3 (short for Anf√§ngerpraktikum - beginner laboratory cousrse) and Practicas Termo (thermodynamics laboratory course) are split into many smaller experiments.
FP (short for Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum - advanced laboratory course) contains fewer but more advanced datasets and data analysis.
